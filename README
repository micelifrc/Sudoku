This program will solve a sudoku, of size SIZExSIZE
The program should be called with extra argument the names of the .txt files where the sudoku patterns are recorded.

A sudoku input is given as a sequence of SIZExSIZE numbers (which can also be displayed on separate lines).
Spaces and new-lines are used to separate the numbers.
An empty tile should be marked as 0, while full tiles will be marked with numbers in the set [1,SIZE].
The following is an example of a possible input file for the standard case of SIZE == 9:

5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9

Observe that the presence of non-numeric characters (like letters) will confuse the program,
this usually results in the program thinking that the file does not provide a table
